## Usage <a id="usage"></a>

Users are required to login in order to create a booking.<br>
Create an account or use this dummy account to log in for user access:
<br><br>
Email: `vintagevicky@email.com`<br>
Password: `test12345`
<br><br>
Users must choose the escape room, number of players, date, and time to successfully create a booking.
As users create bookings, the booked time slots will be unavailable as expected. If a user cancels a booking, the time slots will be available again.
For this project example, I've chosen the business hours to be between 12pm and 8pm. Users can book an escape room every hour between the hours of 12pm and 8pm.
